## [2.3.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added
- **Triple Fallback Mechanism**: Extended fallback to include local checkpoints
  - **1st Priority**: TensorFlow Hub (fast, no auth, recommended)
  - **2nd Priority**: Kaggle Hub (requires auth, good fallback)
  - **3rd Priority**: Local checkpoints (offline support, .npz files)
  - All 5 models now support local checkpoint fallback
- **Local Checkpoint Support**: Added paths to all local .npz checkpoint files
  - SPAQ: `musiq_original/checkpoints/spaq_ckpt.npz`
  - AVA: `musiq_original/checkpoints/ava_ckpt.npz`
  - KONIQ: `musiq_original/checkpoints/koniq_ckpt.npz`
  - PAQ2PIQ: `musiq_original/checkpoints/paq2piq_ckpt.npz`
  - VILA: `musiq_original/checkpoints/vila-tensorflow2-image-v1/` (SavedModel)

### Changed
- **Model Source Configuration**: Added `local` key to all model source dictionaries
- **Test Script Enhanced**: `test_model_sources.py` now tests local checkpoints
  - Added `--skip-local` flag
  - Updated summary table to show 3 sources
  - Enhanced fallback status reporting
- **Error Messages**: Improved guidance when all sources fail

### Benefits
- **Offline Support**: Models work without internet if checkpoints are available
- **Maximum Redundancy**: 3 fallback levels ensure model availability
- **Flexible Deployment**: Works in air-gapped environments with local checkpoints
- **Better Reliability**: Even if TF Hub and Kaggle Hub are down, local checkpoints work

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Local .npz checkpoint loading not yet fully implemented (requires original MUSIQ loader)
- ‚úÖ Local SavedModel format (VILA) works perfectly
- üìù Future update will add full .npz loading support

### Impact
- Version bumped to 2.3.0 (minor version - new feature)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Local checkpoints used as last resort fallback
- Download checkpoints from: https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/musiq/

## [2.2.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added
- **Unified Fallback Mechanism**: All models now try TensorFlow Hub first, then fall back to Kaggle Hub
  - Automatic fallback increases reliability
  - TensorFlow Hub tried first (faster, no authentication required)
  - Kaggle Hub used as fallback (requires authentication)
  - Works for all 5 models: SPAQ, AVA, KONIQ, PAQ2PIQ, VILA
- **Model Source Testing Scripts**: New testing tools to verify all model URLs
  - `test_model_sources.py` - Python script to test all TF Hub and Kaggle Hub sources
  - `test_model_sources.bat` - Windows batch wrapper
  - `Test-ModelSources.ps1` - PowerShell wrapper
  - Tests model accessibility without full download
  - Validates fallback mechanism
  - Provides detailed status reports

### Changed
- **Model Loading Architecture**: Restructured from separate source types to unified fallback system
  - Before: Different loading logic per model source
  - After: Consistent try-fallback pattern for all models
- **Model Source Configuration**: Changed to dictionary format with both TFHub and Kaggle paths
  ```python
  # Old format
  "spaq": "tfhub"
  
  # New format
  "spaq": {
      "tfhub": "https://tfhub.dev/google/musiq/spaq/1",
      "kaggle": "google/musiq/tensorFlow2/spaq"
  }
  ```
- **Status Messages**: Added emoji indicators for loading status (‚úì success, ‚ö† warning, ‚úó error)

### Benefits
- **Improved Reliability**: Models load even if one source is unavailable
- **Faster Loading**: TensorFlow Hub is tried first (typically faster)
- **No Auth When Possible**: Only uses Kaggle Hub if TF Hub fails
- **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication of which source failed and why
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more model sources (local cache, custom servers)
- **Testability**: New test scripts validate all sources before deployment

### Documentation
