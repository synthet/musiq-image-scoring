# Environment Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Successfully Removed

### 1. Empty Directories
- `google-research/` - Empty directory
- `musiq_env/Include/` - Empty Include directory
- `musiq_gpu_env/Include/` - Empty Include directory  
- `musiq_gpu_env/Lib/site-packages/nvidia/cuda_runtime/lib/` - Empty lib directory

### 2. Python Cache Directories
- `musiq/__pycache__/` - Python cache directory
- `musiq_original/model/__pycache__/` - Python cache directory
- All `__pycache__` directories in virtual environments (thousands of them)

### 3. Virtual Environment
- `musiq_env/` - **COMPLETELY REMOVED** ✅
  - This was the CPU-only environment that was no longer needed
  - Freed up significant disk space

## ⚠️ Partially Removed

### `musiq_gpu_env/` - Windows GPU Environment
- **Status**: Partially removed, some files locked by Windows processes
- **Reason**: Some `.pyd` files and DLLs are locked by running processes
- **Impact**: Minimal - this environment is not used since you have WSL2 + Ubuntu + TensorFlow GPU working
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Restart Windows to release file locks, then manually delete the remaining folder
  - Or leave it as-is since it's not actively used

## 🎯 Current Active Environment

### WSL2 + Ubuntu + TensorFlow GPU (Primary)
- **Location**: `~/.venvs/tf/` in WSL2 Ubuntu
- **Status**: ✅ Working perfectly
- **Usage**: All MUSIQ operations now use this environment
- **Scripts**: All Windows scripts (`.bat`, `.ps1`) use this environment

## 📊 Space Savings

### Estimated Space Freed
- `musiq_env/`: ~2-3 GB (complete removal)
- Python cache directories: ~100-200 MB
- Empty directories: Minimal but cleaned up structure

### Remaining Space
- `musiq_gpu_env/` (partial): ~1-2 GB (some files locked)
- This will be freed once Windows releases the file locks

## 🚀 Project Status

### ✅ Clean and Optimized
- **Primary Environment**: WSL2 + Ubuntu + TensorFlow GPU
- **Scripts**: All Windows automation scripts working
- **Documentation**: Complete setup and usage guides
- **Requirements**: All package lists exported
- **Structure**: Clean and organized

### 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)
1. **Restart Windows** to release file locks on `musiq_gpu_env/`
2. **Manually delete** the remaining `musiq_gpu_env/` folder
3. **Continue using** the WSL2 environment for all MUSIQ operations
