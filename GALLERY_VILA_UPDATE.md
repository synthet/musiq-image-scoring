# Gallery Scripts VILA Update

## Overview

Updated `create_gallery.bat` and `Create-Gallery.ps1` to reflect VILA model integration and provide better user guidance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Headers

**Before:**
```
MUSIQ Image Gallery Generator
```

**After:**
```
Image Quality Gallery Generator
MUSIQ + VILA Multi-Model Scoring
```

### 2. Added Model Information

Both scripts now display which models are being used:
```
Models used:
  - MUSIQ models: SPAQ, AVA, KONIQ, PAQ2PIQ
  - VILA models: VILA, VILA-R (if Kaggle auth configured)
```

### 3. Enhanced Processing Messages

**Step 1 Message Updated:**
```
Step 1: Running image quality assessment...
  - Processing with MUSIQ models (SPAQ, AVA, KONIQ, PAQ2PIQ)
  - Processing with VILA models (VILA, VILA-R)

Note: VILA models require Kaggle authentication.
If not configured, VILA will be skipped (MUSIQ will still work).
See README_VILA.md for Kaggle setup instructions.
```

### 4. Updated Success Messages

Gallery creation success now shows:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: Gallery created successfully!
üìÅ Output file: [path]

Gallery includes scores from:
  ‚úì MUSIQ models (always included)
  ‚úì VILA models (if Kaggle auth configured)

Images are sorted by weighted score from all available models.
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Messages

Added VILA-specific troubleshooting:
```
If VILA models failed to load, check README_VILA.md for setup.
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Clear Expectations
- Users now know exactly which models are being used
- Clear indication that VILA is optional (requires Kaggle auth)
- Reference to documentation for setup

### Graceful Degradation
- Scripts clearly state that MUSIQ will still work even if VILA fails
- No breaking changes - existing workflows continue to function
- VILA is additive, not required

### Better Guidance
- Direct reference to README_VILA.md for setup instructions
- Clear success messages showing what was included
- Helpful error messages pointing to solutions

## Technical Details

### No Code Changes
- Only messaging and user interface text updated
- Underlying functionality unchanged
- Still uses `batch_process_images.py` (which already supports VILA)
- Still uses `gallery_generator.py` (which already reads VILA scores from JSON)

### Backward Compatibility
- Works with or without VILA models
- Works with existing JSON files
- No breaking changes to command-line interface

## Files Updated

1. **`create_gallery.bat`**
   - Updated header
   - Added model information display
   - Enhanced processing messages
   - Improved success/error messages

2. **`Create-Gallery.ps1`**
   - Updated header
   - Added model information display
   - Enhanced processing messages
   - Improved success/error messages with color coding

## Usage

### No Changes Required

Users continue to use the scripts exactly as before:

**Windows Batch:**
```bash
create_gallery.bat "C:\Photos\Export\2025"
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\Create-Gallery.ps1 "C:\Photos\Export\2025"
```

### What Users See Now

1. **Welcome screen** shows both MUSIQ and VILA models
2. **Processing phase** explains what models are running
3. **Kaggle note** informs about VILA authentication requirement
4. **Success screen** confirms which models were included
5. **Error messages** guide toward solutions

## Example Output

```
========================================
 Image Quality Gallery Generator
 MUSIQ + VILA Multi-Model Scoring
========================================

Input folder: C:\Photos\Export\2025
Output file: C:\Photos\Export\2025\gallery.html

Creating gallery for images in: C:\Photos\Export\2025

Models used:
  - MUSIQ models: SPAQ, AVA, KONIQ, PAQ2PIQ
  - VILA models: VILA, VILA-R (if Kaggle auth configured)

Step 1: Running image quality assessment...
  - Processing with MUSIQ models (SPAQ, AVA, KONIQ, PAQ2PIQ)
  - Processing with VILA models (VILA, VILA-R)

Note: VILA models require Kaggle authentication.

Step 2: Generating HTML gallery...

‚úÖ SUCCESS: Gallery created successfully!
üìÅ Output file: C:\Photos\Export\2025\gallery.html

Gallery includes scores from:
  ‚úì MUSIQ models (always included)
  ‚úì VILA models (if Kaggle auth configured)

Opening gallery in your default web browser...

Gallery opened! You can now browse your images with quality scores.
Images are sorted by weighted score from all available models.
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Users know exactly what's happening
2. **Confidence**: Clear indication of what models are working
3. **Guidance**: Pointers to documentation when needed
4. **Reassurance**: MUSIQ continues to work without VILA
5. **Professional**: Better UX with clear, helpful messages

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Batch file syntax validated
- [x] PowerShell script syntax validated
- [x] Messages are clear and informative
- [x] Error handling preserved
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] User guidance is helpful

## Next Steps for Users

1. **With Kaggle Auth Setup**: 
   - Run scripts as usual
   - Enjoy both MUSIQ and VILA scores
   - Gallery will show all 6 models

2. **Without Kaggle Auth**:
   - Run scripts as usual
   - See note about VILA during processing
   - Gallery will show 4 MUSIQ models
   - Optionally: Set up Kaggle auth (see README_VILA.md)

## Conclusion

Gallery scripts now properly communicate VILA integration while maintaining backward compatibility and providing excellent user guidance.
